# Genetic Algorithm Diversity Techniques Comparison

This project compares two techniques for maintaining genetic diversity in evolutionary algorithms: Clearing and Crowding. The comparison is based on their performance in optimizing a test function and their execution time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm-diversity.git
    cd genetic-algorithm-diversity
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the analysis and generate the comparison plots, execute the following command:

```bash
python3.9 analysis.py
